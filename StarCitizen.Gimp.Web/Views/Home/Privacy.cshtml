    <div class='innerText'>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age
        of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents
        in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
        agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
        online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br />
        <br />
    </div>

    <div class='innerText'>
        We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

        <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>

    <div class='innerText'>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
        United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
        development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
        Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
        comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br />
        <br />
    </div>

    <div class='innerText'>
        <strong>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
            following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
        </strong>
    </div>

    <div class='innerText'>
        We will notify you via email

    <div class='innerText'>
        <br />
        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals
        have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and
        processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
        individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
        have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
        non-compliance by data processors.
